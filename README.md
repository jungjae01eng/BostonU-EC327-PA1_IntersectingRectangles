# BostonU-EC327-Programming Assignnment 1
## Q1: Intersecting Rectangles
Write a program that reads in two rectangles from the console (STDIN). The rectangles are indicated by their (x, y) lower left coordinate and their length (x) and height (y). You do NOT need to deal with negative numbers and can assume all inputs are integers. The program should then tell if the rectangles intersect or not. You are able to use the <math.h> library in this assignment.

### Example (Sample run):
```
Enter the information for the first rectangle
x-coordinate: <2> <enter>
y-coordinate: <0> <enter>
length: <4> <enter>
height: <5> <enter>

Enter the information for the second rectangle
x-coordinate: <8> <enter>
y-coordinate: <3> <enter>
length: <9> <enter>
height: <1> <enter>

THE RECTANGLES DO NOT INTERSECT [Program Exits]


Enter the information for the first rectangle
x-coordinate: <2> <enter>
y-coordinate: <4> <enter>
length: <5> <enter>
height: <6> <enter>

Enter the information for the second rectangle
x-coordinate: <1> <enter>
y-coordinate: <2> <enter>
length: <5> <enter>
height: <4> <enter>

THE RECTANGLES INTERSECT [Program Exits]
```
